Welcome, dear reader.

This blog site is home to some of my thoughts on tech, music, and life.
I hope the information I provide here will prove useful and entertaining to anyone who stumbles upon this corner of the web.
Feel free to reach out to me via e-mail and have a look at my videos on YouTube, where you'll find my music and more thoughts!

Thanks for visiting!
