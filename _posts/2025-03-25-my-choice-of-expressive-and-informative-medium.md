## My choice of expressive and informative medium

![Random list on a blank page](./images/post_one.jpg "list")

I’ve considered the act of writing a fairly great chore for as long as I can remember. And even today, as a Journalism and Communications major, I sometimes find myself struggling to sit down and write something for the sake of expressing myself, as well as sharing my knowledge with others. This difficulty, I recently realized, stems from the lack of a medium where I’d be happy to share my thoughts on things that I’m passionate about. With that realization in mind, I decided to do the obvious, and surprisingly accessible thing – to start my own blog. 

So, now what? What am I going to write about? Well, thankfully, amidst feverish deliberation of what method I’m going to use to build this website (there’s certainly an overwhelming number of ways to make a blog nowadays), I managed to think of a set of topics I’d like to explore here. More specifically, a combination of three core areas – technology, music, and life itself. The reason I chose to bring these broad areas together is simple, really – I am deeply fascinated by technology (especially music technology), music is profoundly important to me, and I cannot imagine my life without consistently learning about and exploring these things. Therefore, the interplay of these key areas will provide the central theme for the blog posts to come.

Researching music technology in particular is incredibly interesting to me. First and foremost – as a music-maker, I understand that the connection between an artist and the technology they use to produce music is far from two-dimensional. With over 10 years of music-making experience, I’ve grown to appreciate the various influences that pieces of music technology have not only on the creative process and the sonic quality of music being made, but also the artist themselves. Instruments and all kinds of musical devices are, in my opinion, not just tools, but also companions in creative journeys, therapeutical objects and even influencers in that their interfaces of interaction, and the sound itself, can give the creator’s ideas a certain intangible push towards a end result that sometimes strays from the initial idea altogether, especially in the context of experimentation. 

Other topics I’ll be looking into will include the effects of creating art on the creator, the state of (music) technology and its developments and more. I plan to share insights on what I learn through creating art as well, and hopefully conduct some interviews with other creators. I truly hope you visit this part of the web once in a while, keep an eye out for more. Thank you for reading.
